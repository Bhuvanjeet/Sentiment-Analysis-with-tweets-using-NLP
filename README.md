# Sentiment-Analysis-with-tweets-using-NLP

The dataset contains 1,600,000 (1.6M) tweets extracted using the twitter api . 
The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment.

It contains the following 6 fields:

1- target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)

2- ids: The id of the tweet ( 2087)

3- date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)

4- flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.

5- user: the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)

6- text: the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)
